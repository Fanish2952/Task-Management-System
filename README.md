# Task-Management-System
This project is a Task Management System implemented in C++. It provides a simple yet powerful command-line interface for users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, delete tasks, and view their tasks in a list.

Features:
Add Task: Users can add tasks to the system with a title and description.
Mark Task as Complete: Tasks can be marked as complete, helping users keep track of their progress.
Delete Task: Users can remove tasks from the system when they are no longer needed.
List Tasks: The system allows users to view all their tasks in a list format.
How to Use:
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Compile the Code: Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
Run the Executable: Execute the compiled binary to launch the Task Management System.
Interact with the System: Follow the command-line prompts to add, complete, delete, or view tasks.
Structure:
main.cpp: Contains the main logic and user interface implementation.
task.h/task.cpp: Defines the Task class and its member functions for task management operations.
task_manager.h/task_manager.cpp: Implements the TaskManager class responsible for managing tasks and their operations.
